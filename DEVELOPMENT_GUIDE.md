### Phase 6: Polish & Testing (Week 7-8)
1. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error boundaries
   - Network error handling
   - Offline functionality

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Image optimization
   - List virtualization
   - Code splitting and lazy loading

3. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for flows
   - Accessibility testing

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` types)
- Follow React Native and Expo best practices
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Use proper loading states

### Performance
- Optimize images and assets
- Use FlatList for large data sets
- Implement proper caching
- Minimize re-renders with proper dependencies
- Use lazy loading where appropriate

### Security
- Encrypt sensitive health data
- Use secure storage for credentials
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper session management
- Handle API tokens securely

### Accessibility
- Add proper accessibility labels
- Support screen readers
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Use proper color contrast
- Test with accessibility tools

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component testing with React Native Testing Library
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Manual testing on both platforms

## File Structure Details

Each major directory contains placeholder files with detailed instructions:

- **Screens**: Each screen file contains comprehensive implementation details including features, UI components, integration points, and navigation
- **Components**: Organized by type (UI, forms, cards, modals) with clear responsibilities
- **Services**: API clients, storage, notifications, location, and camera services
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for authentication, camera, location, and network status
- **Context**: Global state management for auth, health data, and notifications

## Key Technologies & Packages

**Core:**
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Navigation v6 for navigation

**UI & Styling:**
- Expo Vector Icons for icons
- React Native Paper or NativeBase (to be chosen)
- Styled components or StyleSheet

**Storage & Data:**
- Expo SecureStore for sensitive data
- AsyncStorage for app data
- React Query for API state management

**Device Features:**
- Expo Camera for document/prescription scanning
- Expo Location for facility finding
- Expo Notifications for reminders
- Expo Local Authentication for biometrics

**Development Tools:**
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Jest for testing
- React Native Testing Library
- Flipper for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure all team members have proper development environment
2. **Type Implementation**: Start with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
3. **Authentication Flow**: Implement secure authentication as foundation
4. **UI Component Library**: Build reusable components following design system
5. **Feature Implementation**: Follow the phase-based roadmap above
